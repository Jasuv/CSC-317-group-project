# Todo
- Add Google Fonts (Maybe have 2 fonts, one for headings and one for everything else)
- Add a favicon (optional)
- pseudo-classes/pseudo-elements required (at least, 8 distinct ones!)
- Figure out how to deploy on vercel/render/netlify
- Write the one-page pdf report
- Fix fact #7 (its the same as #6)
- Fix Media Queries
- Reorganize bg pictures to fit facts
- Maybe choose diff "low-income" image (kinda harsh on the eyes)
- UI touch up (Fact# isnt very appealing)
