        <h2>What does 1.5°C global warming mean?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          1.5°C of global warming refers to a world where global average
          combined land surface air and sea surface temperatures are 1.5°C
          warmer than the average of the 51-year period 1850-1900. This is
          equivalent to being 0.87°C warmer than the 20-year period 1986-2005 or
          0.63°C warmer than the decade 2006-2015.

      <section class="question" id="question-2">
        <h2>How close are we to reaching 1.5°C warming?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          Human activities have already caused approximately 1°C of global
          warming above pre-industrial levels as of 2017. If the current warming
          rate continues, the world is projected to reach 1.5°C of warming
          around 2040. However, the exact year that 1.5°C will be reached is
          uncertain and is projected to be between 2030 and 2052. This range is
          influenced by factors such as the chosen confidence level and the
          timeframe used to estimate the current rate of warming.

      <section class="question" id="question-3">
        <h2>What are the potential impacts of reaching 1.5°C warming?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          Even with a 1.5°C increase in global average temperature, warming will
          be greater than 1.5°C in many regions and seasons. At this level of
          warming, the world can expect an increase in the frequency and/or
          intensity of extreme events like droughts, floods, and heat waves.
          Impacts will also include rising sea levels, changes in rainfall
          patterns, and increasing ocean acidification. These changes pose risks
          to various natural and human systems, including ecosystems,
          agriculture, infrastructure, human health, and socioeconomic systems.

      <section class="question" id="question-4">
        <h2>How is warming distributed across different regions?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          Global warming is not uniform and varies across different regions.
          Many regions of the world have already experienced greater
          regional-scale warming than the global average. For example, 20-40% of
          the global population has already experienced over 1.5°C of warming in
          at least one season. Impacts at 1.5°C of global warming depend on the
          pathway taken to 1.5°C. For example, impacts from a pathway that stays
          below 1.5°C throughout the 21st century will be different from a
          pathway that exceeds and then returns to 1.5°C. Additionally, the
          impacts of 1.5°C global warming will vary in both space and time.

      <section class="question" id="question-5">
        <h2>Who is most vulnerable to the impacts of 1.5°C warming?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          The poor and vulnerable are disproportionately affected by warming up
          to and beyond 1.5°C. Many regions with large populations, especially
          in low- and moderate-income countries, face significant poverty and
          unequal access to resources. This makes them more vulnerable to
          climate change impacts, particularly in small and medium-sized cities
          prone to hazards. Small islands, megacities, coastal regions, and high
          mountain ranges are also among the most affected. The report
          highlights that ethical considerations and equity are central to
          addressing the impacts of climate change.

      <section class="question" id="question-6">
        <h2>Why is 1.5°C warming a critical threshold?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          Many climate change risks increase non-linearly with increasing global
          mean surface temperature. This means that every increment of warming
          matters, and limiting warming to 1.5°C would result in significantly
          lower risks compared to higher levels of warming. The report also
          stresses the need to consider equity and ethical concerns when
          evaluating different warming levels. This is because the impacts of
          warming are not distributed equally and will disproportionately affect
          the poor and vulnerable. 1.5°C.

        <h2>
          What happens if global warming temporarily exceeds 1.5°C (an
          &quot;overshoot&quot;)?
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
          If global warming temporarily exceeds 1.5°C before returning to that
          level by or before 2100, it is considered an &quot;overshoot&quot;
          pathway. Even if temperatures return to 1.5°C, an overshoot would lead
          to more severe impacts than staying below 1.5°C. Some impacts, such as
          sea level rise, would continue to increase even after global mean
          surface temperature stabilizes. This means that an overshoot would
          lead to a higher sea level than scenarios where warming remains below
          1.5°C.
